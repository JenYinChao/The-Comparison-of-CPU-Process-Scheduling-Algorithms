# Abstract
Itâ€™s always a complicated issue about choosing algorithm of CPU process scheduling, including FCFS, SJF, RR, SRTF, and HRRN. By simulating CPU processing various cases with different algorithms, the result comes out as the following: SJF and SRTF have the best performance in any scenario, while RR is always the worst one. Considering the preemptive problem, FCFS is actually a suitable choice for CPU process scheduling, which overall performs better than HRRN in most cases and the mean of average waiting time is quite similar to SJF and SRTF, though with higher variance.
